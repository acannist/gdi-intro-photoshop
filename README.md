Having Adobe Photoshop knowledge is an essential tool for web designers, developers, bloggers, or anyone interested in taking their work to the next level. These programs can be intimidating due to their wide range of applications. Whether you’re a novice, or someone who is looking to expand your understanding of the tools, this class is perfect for you! In this workshop we will cover the fundamentals needed to start any project, with an emphasis on web design.

This class is for Photoshop beginners who want to learn the basic lay of the land, talk about when to use Photoshop (and when not to use it) as well as a general overview of the tools, tricks and tips for the latest version of Photoshop.

TAKEAWAYS

This course is open to all proficiency levels. We may reference some basic HTML and CSS concepts but we won't be writing any code.

• We’ll work on a variety of hands-on how-to activities, touching on all the major features Photoshop has to offer - from basic image manipulation, editing text, creating layer effects, borders, shadows, and other dynamic styles.  Let's "develop" it! 

• We’ll also briefly cover a few helpful tips and tricks you can use once you’re ready to build your designs into HTML & CSS!
