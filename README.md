GDI Boston, Intro to Photoshop

Class Description

Having Adobe Photoshop knowledge is an essential tool for web designers, developers, bloggers, or anyone interested in taking their work to the next level. These programs can be intimidating due to their wide range of applications. Whether you’re a novice, or someone who is looking to expand your understanding of the tools, this class is perfect for you! In this workshop we will cover the fundamentals needed to start any project, with an emphasis on web design.

This class is for Photoshop beginners who want to learn the basic lay of the land, talk about when to use Photoshop (and when not to use it) as well as a general overview of the tools, tricks and tips for the latest version of Photoshop.


TAKEAWAYS

This course is open to all proficiency levels. We may reference some basic HTML and CSS concepts but we won't be writing any code.

• We’ll work on a variety of hands-on how-to activities, touching on all the major features Photoshop has to offer - from basic image manipulation, editing text, creating layer effects, borders, shadows, and other dynamic styles.  Let's "develop" it! 

• We’ll also briefly cover a few helpful tips and tricks you can use once you’re ready to build your designs into HTML & CSS!


PREREQS & PREPARATION

You do not need any prior experience with Photoshop. Just come with a desire to learn and the following tools:

• Laptop & Charger

• Photo ID (for security reasons)

• Photoshop installed on your computer. If you do not currently have Photoshop on your computer, you can download and use a free 30-day trial here. (Note: If you are using the free trial, please do not install Photoshop until the day before or the day of class to make sure you get the most out of your free trial!)

All attendees are expected to abide by the Girl Develop It Code of Conduct.
